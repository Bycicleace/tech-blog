## Description
This project is a demonstration on knowledge using the Model/View/Controller structure during development. Some of the Node modules used are Express.js, Handlebars.js, express-session, sequelize, and bcrypt.

This uses a SQL database to store the posts, users, and comments.

## Site Use
On the Homepage, you are presented with existing posts, if any.

On clicking any of the posts, you are brought to a detailed page which shows the post, along with any existing comments, if there are any.

To Sign up, click the Login button, then the `Sign up` link near the bottom of the form. Enter in your credentials, and on submission, you will be logged in.

Once logged in, you will be brought to a dashboard, showing all your posts. From here, you can create a new post by clicking the `New Post` button. To edit or delete an existing post, simply click on the post, then edit and update, or delete the post.

While logged in, and by clicking on a post on the homepage, you will now be able to add your own comments to any post. Simply fill out your comment and hit submit.
